# React Greenfield Project



## Getting Started

```
git clone git@github.com:sanlouise/react-greenfield.git

cd react-greenfield

npm install

npm start
```

## Requirements

* Use webpack, babel, and ES6/7.
* Use mocha/chai to test **at least** all components, actions, and reducers.
* Call an external API (ie. NASA data, homeless pets data, etc.).
* Use d3 for data visualization from the external API's data, and optionally Highcharts for less complex visualizations.
* Use Redux, React Router, and Immutable.js.
